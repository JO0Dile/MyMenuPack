/* ==========================================================================
   CATALOGUE — the only place university, college, plan, and course data
   enters this app.

   Every registry below starts EMPTY and is filled from plans.json, a static
   file shipped alongside the app: universities, colleges, the University
   Elective pool, each plan's free-elective suggestions, and all 34 study
   plans with their courses and prerequisites.

   That file is generated from data/ by tools/build-catalogue.py, so plans are
   still authored and reviewed in one place — but the app needs no server at
   runtime. It is precached by the service worker, so the whole catalogue is
   available offline, first visit onward.

   Plans are handed to the app's own sync module (AAUP_SYNC), so they are
   sanitized and merged by the code that always handled them.

// AUTO-COLLECT endpoint. When set, every plan a user builds or edits in the
// app — its college, courses, prerequisites: plan STRUCTURE only, never any
// personal progress, GPA, grades, name, or ID — is sent here quietly in the
// background so you can gather community plans without anyone pressing a
// "submit" button. This MUST be a small serverless endpoint that holds a
// GitHub token PRIVATELY and commits on the app's behalf (see COLLECTING.md
// for a ready-to-deploy Cloudflare Worker + setup). A static GitHub Pages
// site can't write to the repo by itself, and a token pasted into this file
// would be public — anyone could wipe the repo, and GitHub auto-revokes
// leaked tokens — so it never goes here, only in the collector's secrets.
// Leave '' to disable auto-collection entirely (nothing is sent anywhere).
// The one part of the app that goes online, and only when a student chooses
// to share a plan they built. Everything else works with no network at all.

// simple value is fine. Leave '' to send none.
window.APP_COLLECT_SECRET = 'Winston';
// Which collector you're pointing at, so the app sends in the shape that host
// accepts. Only two values:
//   'cloudflare'  (default) — sends JSON with the secret in a header, and
//                 reads the response to confirm delivery. Use with
//                 collector/cloudflare-worker.js. This is the tested path.
//   'appsscript'  — for a Google Apps Script web app (collector/
//                 google-apps-script.gs). Apps Script can't do the same CORS,
//                 so the app sends a "simple" text POST with the secret inside
//                 the body and can't read the reply back — delivery is
//                 best-effort (the collector overwrites by id, so a rare
//                 retry just re-saves the same plan, never a duplicate).
// Leave it 'cloudflare' unless/until you deploy the Apps Script version.

// SMART ASSISTANT endpoint — a small Cloudflare Worker that holds a free
// Gemini API key privately and answers the in-app assistant's questions (see
// ai/README.md for the 5-minute setup). Same reasoning as the collector above:
// a key pasted into this file would be public, since GitHub Pages serves it to
// anyone. The Worker also holds the assistant's system prompt and the list of
// things it is allowed to do, so those cannot be rewritten from a browser.
//
// Leave '' and the app is unchanged: the assistant runs entirely on-device
// from the knowledge base in js/41-assistant-kb.js, the ✨ toggle never
// appears, and nothing a student types can leave their phone.
//
// Set here in advance to the URL the Worker WILL have once it is deployed —
// Cloudflare names workers <worker-name>.<account-subdomain>.workers.dev, and
// this account's subdomain is already known from the collector. Pointing at a
// Worker that does not exist yet is safe: the fetch fails, the app falls back
// to the on-device assistant, and the student sees a normal answer. So this
// can ship before the Worker does.

// this URL grants nothing. It is here rather than in 48-admin.js because this

// no student ever notices the difference.

// plans follow them to a new device. The only Worker in this project backed
// by a real database (Cloudflare D1) rather than GitHub, since "the same
// account on a second phone" isn't something a device's own storage can do
// alone. See cloud/README.md for the one-time setup.
