// Service worker for the hosted app.
//
// The app is self-contained: shell, styles, modules, icons, and the whole
// study-plan catalogue (plans.json) are all precached, so it works with no
// network at all from the first visit onward. The only thing that ever goes
// online is the plan collector, when a student chooses to share a plan.
// BUMP THIS whenever a precached file changes. It is the only thing that
// makes a browser reinstall the shell.
//
// The trap is that nothing warns you. A browser checks for an update by
// comparing *this file* byte for byte; if sw.js is unchanged it does not
// reinstall, addAll never re-runs, and every already-installed browser keeps
// serving the old cache entries. Shipping a fixed js/48-admin.js therefore
// changed nothing for anyone who had already opened the app — the fix was on
// the CDN, correct and verified, and simply not what the browser ran. The
// fetch handler below does refresh entries one at a time, so it heals after an
// extra reload, but "reload twice" is not a fix anyone can be told to rely on.

// Precached at install rather than opportunistically on first fetch. The
// worker does not control the very first page load, so anything cached only by
// the fetch handler is missed on a first visit — which meant the app looked
// offline-capable but wasn't until you had loaded it twice.
//
// addAll is atomic: one missing file fails the whole install. That is the
// behaviour we want (a half-cached shell is worse than none), but it does mean
// adding a module under js/ requires adding it here too. Forgetting is silent
// — the app looks fine until it is opened without a connection — so the Fix
// panel now compares this list against the files index.html actually loads and
// reports the difference (see the precache-drift check in
// js/44-fix-analyzers.js), and tools/check-precache.py does the same in CI.

// The CATALOGUE is not shell, it is data, and treating it the same way was
// wrong. plans.json is precached at install, so `cached || fetched` handed
// back the copy from install time on every single load and only refreshed the
// cache afterwards — meaning a published change never appeared on the visit
// that fetched it, only on some later one. From the outside that looked like
// edits "only going live when a pull request is merged", because a merge is
// what eventually produced enough reloads.
//
// So anything whose whole purpose is to be current is network-first, falling
// back to the cache when there is no connection. Offline still works: the
// fallback is the same precached copy as before.
