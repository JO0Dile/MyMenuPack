# AAUP catalogue import

Turns the university catalogue document into structured data.

    python3 extract.py   # docx  -> blocks.jsonl    (lossless, document order)
    python3 parse.py     # blocks -> catalogue.json (faculties>programs>sections>courses)
    python3 index.py     # catalogue -> courses-index.json (one entry per course code)

    # The AI & Data Science faculty comes from its own PDF, not the docx:
    python3 parse-ai-pdf.py sources/ai-data-science-faculty.pdf

`blocks.jsonl` and the AI faculty PDF are both committed, so every step runs
without the 4.6 MB source document.

## What is in catalogue.json
13 faculties, 68 programs, 3,076 course entries, 1,797 distinct courses.
Also 37 program overviews and 99 of the author's own notes about individual
programs — "NO real plan yet.", "no academic plan", the note under Bachelor in
Languages listing the four languages a student must pick one of.

Requirement sections per program: `univReq`, `univElec`, `colgReq`, `specReq`,
`specElec`, `freeElec`, `supportCourses` — each with `mustPassAll` or
`requiredHours`, and its course list.

20 programs also carry an `advisoryPlan`: the term-by-term schedule the
university recommends, as `terms[]` of `{year, semester, statedTotal, courses}`.
This is the only place the document says *when* a course is meant to be taken.
Terms include the elective slots the student fills themselves, kept as
`{placeholder: "Univ. Elec.", credits: 2}` because the source names the bucket
and not a course.

## from-images/
Seven Junior College diplomas exist in the document only as screenshots. They
were read image by image and are stored here in the same shape, with
`advisoryPlan` where the source has one. Six reconcile to their stated degree
total exactly; the seventh is cut off in the source and says so:

| program | stated | computed |
|---|---|---|
| Dental Assistance | 64 | 64 |
| Mobile Application Development | 69 | 69 |
| Property Valuation | 74 | 74 |
| Cosmetics and Skincare | 72 | 72 |
| Dental Technology | 78 | 78 |
| Occupational Health and Safety | 72 | 72 |
| Ambulance and Emergency | 73 | 38 — source truncated, see below |

**Diploma in Ambulance and Emergency** was almost lost entirely. It is the only
program in the document with no name line: the pages run "first :" → "About
Program" → the Overview prose, so the words "Diploma in Ambulance and Emergency"
appear nowhere except inside a sentence. It surfaced only by auditing the
paragraphs no parser rule had read. Its Spec. Req. screenshot stops mid-table
and its advisory plan shows one term, so 35 of its 73 credit hours are missing
**from the source**; the gap is recorded in `incompleteInSource` and nothing was
invented to close it.

`program-metadata.json` holds the eight further programs whose only image is a
metadata card — no course table exists for them anywhere in the document, in
text or image. They are marked `coursesInSource: false`.

## Verification
- 0 tables containing courses left unattached to a program/section.
- 0 rows with an impossible credit value; 0 rows flagged uncertain.
- Every one of the 3,076 course codes is 9 digits, as the source prints them.
- Every course code resolves to exactly one name, and to one set of hours:
  `index.py` reports 0 courses where two programs disagree on any field.
- **49 of the 50** programs that state a degree total reconcile to it exactly.
- **182 of 182** advisory-plan terms that print a total match the courses listed
  under them. (15 further terms print no total; that is a source omission.)
- **0 paragraphs and 0 tables in the entire document are left unread.** Every
  block of the source now lands somewhere: a course, a section rule, an
  overview, a program note, a faculty note, or a faculty index list.

## Recorded source discrepancies
Seven programs carry a `sourceIssues` array. Nothing in it is corrected — the
discrepancy is recorded so it travels with the data:

- **Bachelor in Fiqh And Law** states 133 credit hours; its sections list 223.
  The Spec. Req. table holds 55 distinct courses at 3 hours each (28 Law,
  27 Fiqh) with no duplicates and nothing bleeding in from a neighbouring
  program. The document states one total and lists another.
- Six programs whose advisory plan schedules fewer hours than the degree states
  (by 2 to 16). Every printed term total in them matches, so nothing was lost in
  parsing; the university's own recommended schedule simply does not place every
  required hour.

Two of the six image-read programs — Property Valuation and Dental Technology —
carry **two complete academic plans each**, with different course-code families
and different totals. That is deliberate: the document says so in the author's
own words ("this one have 2 academic plans 👍 first one : … now the second
plan:"). Both are stored; the one its advisory plan corroborates is primary and
the other sits under `alternatePlanA`. Dental Technology's prose states a third
figure again (69 hours), recorded in its `sourceConflict`.

## ai-data-science.json
The main document lists the Faculty of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science
by program NAME ONLY. Its course data comes from a separate 48-page faculty PDF
(`sources/ai-data-science-faculty.pdf`), parsed by `parse-ai-pdf.py` into the
same program shape.

13 programs, 446 course rows. **Five carry no plan and say so** in the
document's own words — "No plan", "No plan yet", "Noo plan yet". Of the eight
that do, five reconcile to their stated degree total exactly:

| program | stated | computed |
|---|---|---|
| AI and Cyber Security | 127 | 127 |
| AI and Innovation | 127 | 127 |
| AI and Financial Technology | 121 | 121 |
| **AI and Robotics** | **128** | **128** |
| Finance and Data Science | 127 | 127 |
| AI and Medical Sciences | 129 | 97 — no Spec. Req. section in the PDF |
| Statistics and Data Science | 125 | 50 — Colg. Req. stops after three courses |
| Financial Engineering | 133 | 131 |

The three shortfalls are gaps in the PDF itself and carry
`degreeHoursDiscrepancy`. Nothing is inferred to close them.

AI and Robotics is worth calling out because it can be checked against a
third, independent source: a student's own registrar portal. The PDF gives
Univ. Req. 14, Colg. Req. 59, Spec. Req. 25 — the portal prints the same three
numbers.

## Known gaps (in the SOURCE, not the parser)
- Faculty of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science (13 programs) and Faculty
  of Digital Sciences (6) contain only program NAME lists — captured on the
  faculty as `programNamesListed`, so they are 19 known programs with no course
  data rather than 19 programs that appear not to exist. The document says so
  itself: "i think you already have :" and "and already added all of them, if
  something is missing… tell me now".
- **Bachelor in Public Safety Engineering** states 14 credit hours and lists only
  the university requirements. That is faithful: the document itself writes
  "NO real plan yet." above it, kept in the program's `sourceNotes`.
- Three programs print no degree total at all: Telecommunications Engineering,
  Computer Networks – Minor Information Security, and Modern Media – Digital
  Media and Communication. Their sections are captured; the total is absent, so
  it stays absent.
- Dental Technology's plan A lists a 2-hour Univ. Elec. requirement whose course
  table was never screenshotted. The required hours survive in the text; the
  eligible course list does not exist in the source.

## Nothing is inferred
A value absent from the document is absent here. Names are only ever completed
from a fuller occurrence of the SAME course code elsewhere in the document
(recorded as `nameAsPrinted` when that happens). Where the source prints
something impossible — Dental Technology's DENTAL MATERIALS shows 100 weekly
theoretical hours — the value is kept verbatim and flagged, not corrected.
