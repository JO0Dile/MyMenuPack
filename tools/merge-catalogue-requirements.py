"""Write the university's own requirement buckets into data/aaup/majors/*.json.

The app has always guessed which requirement a course belongs to. It derives
the bucket from a course's VISUAL category (core / math / dept / uni / free),
which is a display choice, not the university's taxonomy - so "University
Requirements" on the My Path screen showed 11 hours where the student portal
says 14, and College vs Specialization could not be told apart at all because
nothing in the data distinguished them.

tools/catalogue-import/catalogue.json now carries the real answer, straight
from the university's published plans: every course's section (univReq,
univElec, colgReq, specReq, specElec, freeElec, supportCourses) and how many
hours each section requires.

    python3 tools/merge-catalogue-requirements.py [--check]

--check reports what would change and writes nothing.

Only majors in PAIRS below are touched, and only after this script has proved
that EVERY course in the app's plan appears in that catalogue program. A
partial match is refused: half a taxonomy is worse than none, because the
missing half looks like a zero rather than an absence.
