"""Build web/contacts.json from data/aaup/contacts.json.

Same reasoning as build-catalogue.py: data/ is where this is authored and
reviewed, web/ is what actually ships. Kept as its own tiny script rather
than folded into build-catalogue.py because contacts are not part of the
plan/course data model at all — mixing them would make one script own two
unrelated things.

    python3 tools/build-contacts.py

Run it after editing data/aaup/contacts.json, then commit web/contacts.json.
