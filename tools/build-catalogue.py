"""Build web/plans.json — the whole catalogue as one static file.

The app is offline-first and self-contained: it ships its catalogue rather
than asking a server for it at runtime. This turns the authored data under
data/ into the exact structure the app's own plan renderer consumes, so there
is no live API in the loop and no server that can be asleep when a student
opens the app.

data/ stays the place plans are authored and reviewed. This is the build step
that publishes them.
